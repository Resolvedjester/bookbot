# bootbot
BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

To use:     Clone the repo into whatever working directory you choose to use.
            When running "python3 main.py" you will need an additional arguement, in this case the RELATIVE path to the books .txt file 
            i.e python3 main.py books/(filename).txt
            failure to add the second arugement will result in an error and exit of the program.
